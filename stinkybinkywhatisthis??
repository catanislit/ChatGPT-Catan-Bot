// 
imma store all the sample code chatGPT gives me for my catan bot here.
IDFK how to code like that, I just took some CS courses in college and then kinda dipped before things got too hard.
But, chatGPT's kinda lit so imma fuck around (and find out). also, did you know Uncle Roger had one of these?

To make a data structure that represents the state of a game of Catan, you'll need to consider what information is relevant to the game 
and how you can represent that information in a way that a computer can understand. One way to do this might be to create an object that 
stores the positions of the settlements and roads, the resources each player has, and any other information that is relevant to the game. 
For example, you could create a GameState class with properties like settlements, roads, and players, where each property is an array or 
collection of objects that represent the relevant information.
//

class GameState {
  constructor() {
    this.settlements = [];
    this.roads = [];
    this.players = [];
  }
}

//
This GameState class defines a data structure that can be used to represent the state of a game of Catan. It 
has three properties: settlements, roads, and players, which are all initially empty arrays. To use this class, 
you would create an instance of the GameState class and then populate its properties with information about the 
game. For example, you might add code to track the positions of the settlements and roads on the game board, and 
to store information about the resources each player has. Here's an example of how you might do this:
//
const gameState = new GameState();

// Track the positions of the settlements and roads on the game board
gameState.settlements.push({ x: 3, y: 4 });
gameState.settlements.push({ x: 5, y: 6 });
gameState.roads.push({ startX: 3, startY: 4, endX: 5, endY: 6 });

// Store information about the resources each player has
gameState.players.push({
  id: 1,
  resources: {
    wood: 5,
    brick: 4,
    sheep: 3,
    wheat: 2,
    ore: 1
  }
});
gameState.players.push({
  id: 2,
  resources: {
    wood: 4,
    brick: 3,
    sheep: 2,
    wheat: 1,
    ore: 0
  }
});
//
In this example, the gameState object is an instance of the GameState class, and it stores information about the 
positions of the settlements and roads on the game board, as well as information about the resources each player has.
